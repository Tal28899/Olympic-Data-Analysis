🏅 Olympic Data Analysis & Visualization App

A professional data analysis and visualization project built using Python to explore Olympic history data.
This project focuses on clean data handling, analytical insights, and meaningful visualizations to understand athlete performance, countries’ participation, and medal trends over time.

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes 120+ years of Olympic data to extract insights such as:

Athlete performance patterns

Medal distribution trends

Country-wise participation analysis

Relationship between physical attributes (age, height, weight) and medal outcomes

The goal is not just visualization, but data-driven reasoning with validation and correctness.

🧠 Key Features

✔️ Robust data preprocessing pipeline

✔️ Country-wise & year-wise Olympic analysis

✔️ Scatter plots for athlete attributes vs medals

✔️ Handling missing data and validation checks

✔️ Clean modular Python code (separation of concerns)

📊 Visualizations Included

Medal distribution over time

Athlete age, height, and weight scatter plots

Country-wise medal performance

Gold / Silver / Bronze trend analysis

All visualizations are created with clarity and analytical intent, not just aesthetics.
